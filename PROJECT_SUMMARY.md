# Project Summary

## What Was Built

A complete Full Stack File Uploader and Tracker web application meeting all requirements specified in the assignment.

### Backend (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy)
- ✅ File upload API endpoint (`POST /upload-document`)
- ✅ File listing API endpoint (`GET /api/files`)
- ✅ SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ File metadata tracking (original filename, system filename, file size, upload timestamp)
- ✅ Local file storage with UUID-based unique filenames
- ✅ Automatic database table creation

### Frontend (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
- ✅ Upload page with file input and status display
- ✅ File history page with table display
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI design
- ✅ Client-side JavaScript for API integration
- ✅ Real-time upload feedback

### Documentation
- ✅ Complete `DOCUMENTATION.md` with setup instructions
- ✅ Design decisions explained
- ✅ Challenges faced and solutions documented
- ✅ AI tool usage disclosure

## Key Features

1. **Unique Filename Generation**: Uses UUID to prevent naming conflicts
2. **Database Synchronization**: Ensures file and metadata are stored together
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks and user-friendly errors
4. **Clean Code**: Well-commented, modular structure
5. **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes

- `GET /api/files` - Get all file metadata

## Database Schema

**FileMetadata Table:**
- id: Integer (Primary Key)
- original_filename: String
- system_filename: String (Unique)
- file_size_bytes: Integer
- uploaded_at: DateTime

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: FastAPI 0.104.1

- **Server**: Uvicorn 0.24.0
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript
- **File Upload**: python-multipart 0.0.6

## Notes

- Database and uploaded_files directory are created automatically on first run
- All files are stored with UUID-based unique names to prevent conflicts
- The application is fully functional and ready to use
- Documentation includes detailed explanations of all design decisions
